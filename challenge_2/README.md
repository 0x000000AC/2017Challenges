#Single Number

##Premise

-	For this coding challenge you are given an array of random integers where every integer is repeated except for a single one. Your challenge is to find the single integer that does NOT repeat.

example: given array = [2,3,4,2,3,5,4,6,4,6,9,10,9,8,7,8,10,7] your program should return: 5

-	Assume that the array can hold infinitely many integers. Can you make your solution run in linear time O(n)? Good luck!

- attempt to search through the array with characters
extra credit: given array = [2,a,l,3,l,4,k,2,3,4,a,6,c,4,m,6,m,k,9,10,9,8,7,8,10,7] your program should return: c

##Testing

At the moment the testing script only works with python and any compiled executable. Please have your program contain 'solution' in its name.

To see if your code works, run the script:

     /2017Challenges/_bin/test

####Expected input:

    2,3,4,2,3,5,4,6,4,6,9,10,9,8,7,8,10,7

####Expected output:

    5
