The program will ask you to first input the size of the array,
then after that you need to fill in the integers.

in the function findSingleInt it will first loop the array to find the maximum value,
use that value to allocate a big enough array for mapping out how many times each integer appears.

After it have mapped it out, it goes through the integer again to find which value only appeared once.
