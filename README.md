# Year of Challenges 2017

Hello and welcome to the Year of Programming 2017's challenges repository! Here
we will be posting ~~daily~~ periodic challenges for the community to complete.

## Challenges

Each challenge will be posted in its own folder, in numbered order. Each
challenge folder will have a Challenge.md file describing the challenge, and may
have some example code or data provided.

## Solutions

To participate, simply fork the repository and then make a folder for your
solution, inside the challenge you are solving.

If I am solving the example challenge in Rust, I would work in the folder
`challenge_example/rust/myrrlyn`, to organize solutions by their language and
then their author. This allows us to easily browse solutions by language, and
compare work!

## Submitting Your Work

To submit, just open a pull request on the main repository. We'll make sure
that merging won't cause any problems, and go from there.
