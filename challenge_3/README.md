#Majority Element

##Premise

-	Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

-	You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

for example, given array = [2,2,3,7,5,7,7,7,4,7,2,7,4,5,6,7,7,8,6,7,7,8,10,12,29,30,19,10,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7] your program should return 7

##Testing

At the moment the testing script only works with python and any compiled executable. Please have your program contain 'solution' in its name.

To see if your code works:

     /2017Challenges/_bin/test <challenge #> <language> <name>
    

####Expected input:

    2,2,3,7,5,7,7,7,4,7,2,7,4,5,6,7,7,8,6,7,7,8,10,12,29,30,19,10,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7

####Expected output:
